        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The GOAT of all southern food</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) cans evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring 
                to a boil. Stir in the macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta
                uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through but is 
                still slightly firm, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Slowly melt butter in a large pot over low heat. Stir in evaporated
                milk and black pepper; cook until heated through.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth; whisk about 1/2 cup of the 
                evaporated milk mixture into the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a
                time, until thoroughly incorporated. Whisk the egg mixture back
                into the saucepan with evaporated milk mixture. Continue
                to heat gently, whisking constantly, until the evaporated 
                milk mixture almost comes to a simmer and the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Gently mix salt and cooked macaroni into the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the 
                prepared casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded
                Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers three more times; top last 
                cheese layer with paprika to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
